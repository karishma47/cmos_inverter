# cmos_inverter
<p >My first experiment with a CMOS inverter in Cadence Virtuoso involved using various Cadence software backend tools with 90nm technology. I utilized the Virtuoso Schematic Editor and Virtuoso Layout Editor for the initial design stages. For simulation, I employed the Spectre tool, and for verification, I relied on the Assura tool.</p>
<p>The process began with schematic creation and symbol generation, followed by pre-layout simulations to observe waveforms. After that, I moved on to layout design and performed Design Rule Checks (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification. I also conducted RC extraction (RCX) and worked with the AV-extracted view for post-layout simulations. Finally, I generated the GDSII file for the completed design.</p>
